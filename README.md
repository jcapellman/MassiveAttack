# MassiveAttack

What started out as a MonoGame using my 2k16 SOA turned into a return to using OpenGL with C++.  The version 1.0 goal is to provide a cross-platform online deathmatch akin to a 90s shooter.

##Areas to work on
- WebAPI with a Redis and SQL Server backend using ASP.NET Core (C#)
- OpenGL/C++ cross-platform client
- WPF frontend to handle client updates and configuration (will consider GTK# for non-Windows clients)
